# Say Hello

This is a simple package that contatins a `sayHello` function which returns ``Hello World!`` or ``Hello ${name}!``.

The purpose of creating this package was to prepare a guide on how to create and publish NPM packages using TypeScript. You can find the repository with the steps and guides at [this Github repository](https://github.com/Pivee/Say-Hello-to-NPM).
